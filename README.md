# Summer Mini Project

Perhaps building on the JSON that we did before, perhaps starting from scratch, but using your C# skills honef over the year. 

There are more details and links [in this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BFHsfVk8gv7KRM68lHrX0q4Mnudm0bpI-2RcwV4q7cw/edit?usp=sharing). 

There are three parts to this mini-project: 

## What does success look like?

Specify a problem - don't just open Visual Studio and start hammering away at your keyboard. Think of a question on which  you can spend a few weeks. 

## Write some code 

Making sure that you're keep your aims in mind. "How will I know that I'm heading in the right direction?"

## Show it off 

In the last lesson of term (Wednesday 6th) I'd like you to demo/present what you've done. 3-5 minutes to show off your code, aims and results. 

# NEA

We will introdue the NEA before the end of term, this project *can* be a foundation for it, but does not have to be.
